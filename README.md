# Travel_App_Flutter_Assignment
ተጓዥ: A Flutter Tourism App
This is my first Flutter project, and I’ve learned various concepts while developing it. ተጓዥ is a tourism application designed to assist travelers by providing information about Ethiopia’s diverse destinations.

Key Features:
Search & Filter: Tourists can search for locations by name or filter by category.
Favorites: Save favorite destinations for easy access.
Nearby Hotels: View a list of hotels near selected destinations, including their prices.
User Profile: Includes a profile page for managing user information.
Data Management:
While I initially tried to integrate Firebase, I encountered version compatibility issues. As a workaround, I created model files located in the lib/model directory to serve as a static database. These models, resembling JSON files, store the necessary data, which is accessed by the app's various screens.
